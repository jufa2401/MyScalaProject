# MyScalaProject

This is my assignments for the course CS152 - Programming Paradigms, taught by Jon Pearce at San Jose State University.
Additional homework for each week will be added after we turn in Homework.
Problem descriptions can be found [here](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/modules/courses/Fall18/CS152/assignments/index.htm)

# WARNING
I have not necessarily corrected the homework afterwards, if the teacher found errors, or "bad code".

# Coding philosophy for this class
JUST DO IT
